          <p class="mb-0">"Nucleus was supposed to be what those [sic] annoying Pied Piper guys did. We tried to compete
            with Richard's horrendous algorithm but we failed. This, however, did not dishearten us: history has proven
            multiple times that often the greatest fall, not the worst! So we realised we fell and we shall rise again.
            We were kind enough to land our expertise to Pied Piper and help them create the greatest gaming platform:
            the rebranded Nucleus! "</p>

        <p>A storefront? A gaming platform? And how is Pied Piper involved?</p>

          Pied Piper comes into the picture. With their so-so compression technology, <b>amazingly improved by former
