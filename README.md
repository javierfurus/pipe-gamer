# What else?
In all seriousness, this is a tiny project to practice my Express skills. It has some interesting features: a cart, the ability to add reviews, the ability to add and remove favorites and some more. Nothing too fancy
# How to run?
Just simply run ```docker-compose up``` (with ```sudo``` if you are not part of the usergroup). After that ```docker exec -it pipe-gamer sh``` within which run ```npm run db:migrate``` followed by ```npm run db:seed```
